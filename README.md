# Your Very Own Pixel Farm!
Welcome! This is a pixel farming game -- not a stardew valley copy, notably. You play as an owl (my favorite animal) and have access to a map where you have the ability to do different activities, including but not limited to: 
- Farming (obviously)
- Cutting down trees
- Feeding animals
- Breaking rocks
- ...and more?

Hope you enjoy! 


## FAQ & Game Keys
**Movement:** WASD or arrow keys, whichever suits your fancy!
**Equipping and unequipping tools:** Click using your LMB (left mouse button) on the tools panel on the bottom of your screen to equip, and then click your RMB (right mouse button) to unequip.

**What are the arrow thingies below the "Day" sign?** Speed up your game! If you're planting crops and aren't willing to wait around for half an hour or so, speed up the game by up to 200x to get your crops fully grown ASAP! 
**What crops can I plant?** Corn and tomatoes! 
**Who are the NPCs?** Niklas and Nicole are there to guide you! Niklas will be the one who first introduces you to the game, so that you're not confused about everything. Nicole will have some handy tips for you, so go talk to both of them! They'll love to get to know you.


## Other Details
The tileset, player (+ player animations), NPC, tree, rock, etc. sprites are all custom designed by me with Photopea! I used a few asset packages for some of the other tools, but the majority of the sprites are all hand-drawn! (I'm not an artist though, so don't judge please) 
The little GitHub icon on the bottom right takes you to this page! When you're playing, you'll be able to check out this GitHub page if you so wish.
