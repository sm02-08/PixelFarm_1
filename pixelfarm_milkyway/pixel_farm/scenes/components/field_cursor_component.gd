	why check for "remove dirt" first? 
	because in the input map, we use the left mouse button for both remove dirt AND hit (tilling) but for remove dirt, we have a dual hit combo (ctrl + lmb) so if "hit" was first, we'd only ever have the tilling happen, because it wouldn't be checking for the remove dirt part. the lmb would always be called and then "hit" would always be called
