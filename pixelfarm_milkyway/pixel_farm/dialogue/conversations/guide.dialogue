Niklas: Welcome to your new farm! Your cows and chickens are hungry--you need to feed them!
Niklas: I've got just the thing. Here, take some seeds.

Niklas: Use the tilling tool to create tilled land, plant your seeds, and use the watering can to water them.
Niklas: Press RMB (right mouse button) to disable your tools.
